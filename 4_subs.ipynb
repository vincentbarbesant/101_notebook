    "    This notebook is an introduction to power system operations. The operation of electrical power grids have been studied for many years around the world and involves many activities. Power grids, especially transmission grid, aims to transporting electricity over long distances from power plants to consumers. To be efficient and minimize energy losses, power grids often operate under high voltages (above 100kV). One of the main goals for power grid operators is to ensure a reliable and secure continuity of delivery of electricity to consumers under some additional quality criterion that can vary from one country to another.  \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    For simplicity, a four substations grid is presented here with producers and consumers meshed through a grid. However, transmission grids are more complex and have many long lines that connect different cities or states. The grid often covers an entire country linking hundreds of power plants and distribution networks. But this should illustrate clearly enough how congestion could arise on the power grid and which operation can help manage it. Congestion management is actually the most critical and time-consuming task for a power grid operator.\n",

    "    A power line has some physical capacity, aka thermal limit. Hence there is maximum power flow that is allowed through a line. Beyond it, a power line can break or can induce high risk for the safety of neighboring goods and people. We then say that a power line is congested, as illustrated by the power flow highlighted in yellow above. In that case, operators usually have only few minutes to reduce the flow in the congested line. It is very usual for electrical operators to set up the thermal limits above 80% of the line capacity as a warning signal to avoid undesired damages in the equipment.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    The first thing operators need to know are the power flows through the lines of the grid to anticipate and monitor congestions. Power flows can actually be computed through physical simulators, under what is called a load flow computation, given productions, consumptions and the topology (aka the graph) of the grid.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    As a first intuition, power flows increase when electrical consumption increases. More specifically, the flows in lines are affected by the dynamics of much electrical consumption and the availability of power plants or productions. It often varies along the course of a day, as consumer behaviors and usages change depending on the hour of the day: there are more activities in the middle of the day, while lighting is used mostly overnight and people finally get to sleep, leaving mostly electrical heating systems as well as some few industries in operations.   \n",
    "<br><br>  \n",
    "    As demand on power system increases over the years, the transmission system is more often forced to operate to its limits.  The congestion could be caused by day to day demand, but can also be due to some other factors such as topology grid changes by operator's actions, lines in maintenance or transient faults that can lead to cascading failures or put the system in an instability condition.\n",

    "    A disconnected line changes the configuration on the grid and causes a power flow's redistribution in the grid. Sometimes these undesired events lead to some overloads in other lines. You have not guess the reason why yet? The answer is very intuitive. When a thunder hits a line, the same amount of energy is demanded by customers but now you have one path less in the grid to transmit the energy, and if one via is affected the others will be loaded with more power.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    Substations are equipped with relays to disconnect a line whether a malfunctioning is detected. Normally the criteria to disconnect a line under an overload condition is to measure the flow and the time a line remains with some flow. Above a given threshold the relay order to open a line.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    This behavior occurs many times in electrical systems and the expertise and vast knowledge of operators help to alleviate the stress in order to guarantee energy to customers. A similar action could be replicated using pypownet. We simulate a disconnection in our small grid to see the resultant state of the grid.\n",

It consists of two bars which are link together and branches could be connected to whatever of those. Substations in pypownet have this pre-defined configuration, which means that you can create to two electrical nodes per substations simulating a node-splitting.\n",

    "    When an overload is detected, operators have to execute a remedial action to alleviate the stress in the system. Normally the experience gained by years by people who work in electrical control rooms is a crucial factor to determine the best one. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    Transmission networks are a bit complex with many paths where the power can flow (mesh grids). This also gives many alternatives to solve the congestions. In many countries changing the production is a valid solution. For instance, you can decrease the flow in the generators which are connected to the overloaded line and increase others that are near the consumptions.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    However, the previous one is costly, especially in countries where producers are market actors. An always cheap one is to play with the main grid configuration, thus one does not have to change the productions. These are the kind of actions RTE wants to build a new smart controllers for through the challenge. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    To illustrate the issue, let's imagine the flow in the line 1-4 and 1-3 have increased by some external factor (such a lightning in the line 1-2). How one would solve the congestion with topological reconfiguration? Actually, one solution is to split the substation 4 and connect the line a selective path 1-2-4. Thus, a fictitious double line is created to supply the energy for load in substation 4.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    This action can be modeled with pypownet as well. In the next lines of code, you can see all the steps needed to perform the desired action and to get the grid with the power flow results. A new configuration layout should be provided by the user. For example, in the example described below, we execute an action to split the node 4 and connected the extremity with the line that comes from the node 1, line 2 and the respective load.\n",

    "    In this notebook, we reviewed very quickly the main operation principles in transmission networks with a small grid. The continuity of the electric power service is indispensable due to the fact clients in transmission grids are majorly distribution networks or large industries. A desired line disconnection without an effective action that could solve the problem might bring blackouts and economic losses. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    As we mentioned earlier, transmission operation involves many tasks but all of them are met to have one single objective: supply reliable and secure electricity. Operators work every day to minimize the impact of external factors that put the electrical system at risk but eventually when the grid is large and meshed, the daily operation is more complicated.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    The Pypownet platform was designed to interact together with the reinforcement learning approach. It allows executing actions in the transmission grid to manage lines with congestion without any cost involved. We covered all actions such as line disconnection and node splitting in the respective section. A user could play and execute more complicated ones.  \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    The end state during the challenge is to train an agent able to learn a policy that could overcome obstacles that will be intentionally placed in some lines trying to reflect a real operation in transmission grids.\n",
